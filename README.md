# Surge-FX Standalone

This is the Surge FX set as a standalone AU and VST3.

Right now it is mac only and unusable.

But if you are brave

```
cd (someplace)
git clone https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-fx
cd surge-fx
git submodule update --init --recursive
make build
```

and you should in theory get a VST3 and AU ready to go.
